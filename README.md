# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project detects whether a news article is Fake or Real using Machine Learning techniques.

## Objective
To build a model that classifies news articles as Fake or True using NLP and classification algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains two files:
- Fake.csv
- True.csv

## Methodology
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Text Cleaning
4. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## Results
The model successfully classifies fake and real news with good accuracy.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries
2. Open the notebook file
3. Run all cells
